# Ionic Assessment App

Finished Assignement 1 and 2. 
Built using the latest **Ionic** version and **Angular**. Mostly used the latest Ionic UI components available and a little bit of CSS tweaks.
Created Rest service that fetch JSON with response:
```json
{
    "name": "Etheruem",
    "shortCode": "ETH",
    "description":"Ethereum is an open source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions.",
    "pricing": {
        "price": "100",
        "currency": "CHF"
    }
   
}
```
